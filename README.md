### 'Wandering' Light theme ###
This is a variation of the 'Wandering' theme created by Matthew Anderson (which was based on the Sunburst theme by Soryu).

It's currently a work-in-progress, but I hope to refine it as I go. Patches are, of course, more than welcome.

### Why? ###
I wanted a reliable, well-colored, light theme and most of the existing ones are atrocious. Matt's 'Wandering' theme is a really solid dark theme, and addresses the majority of the use cases a Web Developer is likely to encounter, as far as code coloring is concerned. So, using that as a base, I feel that I can create a really robust lighter companion theme.
